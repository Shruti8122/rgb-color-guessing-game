# 🎨 RGB Color Guessing Game

## 🌟 Project Overview

The **RGB Color Guessing Game** is a classic web-based challenge where users must correctly identify a specific color based on its unique RGB (Red, Green, Blue) code displayed at the top of the screen.

This project showcases a **modern, professional frontend design** featuring a dark, glassmorphism aesthetic, subtle micro-interactions, and a responsive layout. The core functionality has been enhanced with a lives/chances system to add a layer of challenge and strategy to the game.

## ✨ Features

* **Two Difficulty Modes:**
    * **Easy:** Presents 3 color squares with 1 chance to guess correctly.
    * **Hard:** Presents 6 color squares with 3 chances to guess correctly.
* **Modern UI/UX:** Utilizes CSS features like `backdrop-filter` (Glassmorphism) and smooth transitions for a sleek, polished look.
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for seamless gameplay on both desktop and mobile devices.
* **Interactive Feedback:** Provides immediate visual feedback, fading out incorrect squares and displaying a controlled glow on the winning color.
* **Pure Vanilla Stack:** Built entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, demonstrating clean, efficient front-end logic without any frameworks or external libraries.
